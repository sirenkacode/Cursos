   <h3>Mermaid 2007</h3>
  <p>The experience of the deluded and at times ignorant girl who wants a life outside her class, being hit by the brutality of indifference, poverty and inequality of opportunities. In the post-soviet era and the propaganda invasion of instant happiness, Alisa is just one of the many little mermaids out there.</p>
   <p>I love how as Alisa seemed to align herself on a path to happiness, or at least began to accept and assimilate her life, the story that seemed to have a happy ending was derailed by a tragedy, making it clear that there is no magical or karmic correlation between our will and reality, keeping the frequent reading of the little mermaid, adapted to today.</p>

   <h3>Sisters 2001</h3>
   <p>It reminds me Leon The Professional, but the girls are so badass that they look after themselves, because Russia.</p>
   
   <h3>Lilya 4-ever 2002</h3>
   <p>I was expecting something dramatic on Fucking Amal's level, and got Lars Von Trier. Highly not recommended to watch in the night by yourself, I had nightmares after this and it's not even a horror movie, it's worse, it's real life.</p>

   <p>I'm devastated and at the same time I need everyone to see this movie. There's nothing else to add.</p>

   <p>The only moment I smiled was when Lilya and Andrei were listening to "Nas Ne Dogonyat - t.A.T.u." in the car, which is a nice easter egg since the band was inspire by the movie Fucking Amal (by the same director). They even have a song in tribute to this movie called "show me love" (the alternative title for FA)</p>

   <p>I love when artists come across each others work.</p>
