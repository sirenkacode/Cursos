    <h2>Frontend Developer (in depelopment)</h2>
    <p>I’ve always been fascinated by languages of all kinds—whether it’s the beauty of human languages or the structure of computer code. I enjoy connecting with both people and machines, but what I love most is understanding how others think and learning from their ways of seeing the world.</p>

    <p>I’m a traditional artist transitioning into the digital space, blending my fine art background with an interest in software development, video games, and QA automation. I’m self-taught in nearly everything I’ve learned so far, and I’m always excited to explore new things.</p>
        
    <p>Looking forward to meeting you!</p>
